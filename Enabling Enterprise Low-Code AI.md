Enabling Enterprise AI: A Phased Approach to Low-Code/No-Code Transformation
The Challenge: From AI Promise to Production Value
Enterprises are eager to harness the power of Generative AI but face a critical bottleneck: overwhelming their core engineering teams with requests for internal tools and automations. Low-code and no-code platforms (like Microsoft Copilot Studio, n8n, Google Agentspace, and Glean) promise to empower "citizen developers" within business units, but this creates a new set of challenges:
 * Shadow IT Risk: Without proper oversight, organizations risk creating a landscape of insecure, expensive, and unreliable AI solutions.
 * Tool Sprawl: The market is flooded with tools, making it difficult to select the right platform and AI models that align with existing tech stacks, security policies, and business goals.
 * Wasted Effort: Teams may waste valuable time on low-impact projects or attempt overly complex automations that are doomed to fail, souring the organization on AI's potential.
 * Spiraling Costs: Inefficient workflows, poor model selection, and a lack of monitoring can lead to unpredictable and spiraling API costs.
Sogeti provides the essential "scaffolding" of expertise, architecture, and governance required to unlock the full potential of low-code AI safely and effectively. Our approach is not to build every workflow, but to enable your organization to innovate with confidence. We do this through a phased journey that begins with a strategic Jump Start and matures into a continuous partnership with our AI Innovation Pod.
Phase 1: The Low-Code AI Enabler Jump Start
This is an immersive, two-day strategic discovery experience designed to transform AI complexity into strategic clarity. We align your business goals with technical possibilities, establishing the foundational strategy for your low-code AI program. This phase is about planning and preparation before any tools are deployed or workflows are built.
In-Scope Activities & Deliverables:
1. Assessment & Recommendations
 * Use Case Identification & Prioritization Workshop: We work with your business and IT leaders to identify and prioritize high-impact, low-complexity processes that are prime candidates for AI automation. This prevents teams from wasting time on low-value projects and ensures early wins.
 * Tool & Platform Stack Selection: Our experts provide unbiased, vendor-agnostic recommendations for the right low-code platforms and Generative AI model providers (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini). The recommendation is tailored to your existing tech stack, budget, security requirements, and integration needs.
 * Data Readiness & Strategy Assessment: We assess the accessibility, quality, and structure of your internal data sources (e.g., SharePoint, CRMs, knowledge bases) to determine their readiness for use in AI applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
2. Setup Initial Infrastructure & Governance Framework
 * Educational Demonstrations: We use working code and pre-built accelerators to demonstrate the art of the possible, illustrating key capabilities and integration complexities within the context of your business.
 * Governance & Security Framework: We establish the initial governance framework for security, compliance, and quality assurance. This includes defining protocols for data handling, access control, and responsible AI practices to prevent the creation of "shadow IT."
3. Strategic Planning & Roadmap
 * 12-Month Implementation Roadmap: We deliver a prioritized roadmap that outlines a phased approach for rolling out your low-code AI program, defining clear success metrics and KPIs.
 * Citizen Developer Playbook Outline: We create the foundational outline for a "Center of Excellence" playbook. This document will guide your citizen developers on best practices, security rules, and the process for getting new workflows approved.
| Engagement Details |  |
|---|---|
| Duration | 2-Day Intensive Workshop |
| Delivery Method | On-site or Virtual |
| Team | Sogeti AI Strategists, Solution Architects, and Design Thinking Facilitators |
| Key Deliverables | Strategic Roadmap, Prioritized Use Cases, Tool Stack Recommendation, Governance Framework |
Phase 2: Architecture, Design & Enablement (AI Innovation Pod)
Following the Jump Start, the engagement transitions into a flexible, ongoing partnership with the Sogeti AI Innovation Pod. This moves from strategic planning to active enablement. The Pod provides on-demand access to a cross-functional "brain trust" to ensure the workflows your teams build are secure, scalable, and cost-effective. This phase is delivered via a monthly retainer, giving you access to our entire team at a predictable cost.
In-Scope Services (Delivered via "Ignition" or "Turbo" Pod Tiers):
1. Low-Code Solution Architecture Design & Review
 * This is our most critical service. Our experts provide architectural blueprints and, more importantly, review the workflows built by your citizen developers to ensure they meet enterprise standards for:
   * Scalability & Cost-Effectiveness: Preventing inefficient designs that drive up API costs or break under load.
   * Security: Ensuring proper management of API keys, credentials, and the handling of sensitive data (PII).
   * Maintainability: Avoiding "spaghetti" logic that is impossible to debug or transfer ownership of.
2. Prompt Engineering & Template Library Creation
 * Our team designs, tests, and documents a library of highly effective, pre-approved prompt templates tailored to your specific use cases (e.g., summarizing meeting notes, drafting marketing copy). This ensures consistency and high-quality outputs without requiring every user to become a prompt engineering expert.
3. Citizen Developer Training & Playbook Creation
 * We develop and deliver hands-on training programs and a comprehensive "playbook" for your citizen developers. This empowers your teams to innovate effectively within the safe and secure architectural guardrails our experts have designed.
| AI Pod Tiers | Monthly Capacity | Ideal Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Ignition | 40 hours/month | Sparking Innovation: Perfect for initial architecture reviews, prompt library creation, and delivering the first round of citizen developer training. |
| Turbo | 80 hours/month | Building Momentum: Ideal for providing ongoing, active review of multiple team workflows, developing advanced solutions, and building out a full Center of Excellence. |
Phase 3: Governance, Operations & Optimization (AI Innovation Pod)
This is the maturity phase of your low-code AI program, focused on long-term management, security, and optimization. This is delivered through the AI Innovation Pod, ensuring your program remains secure, cost-effective, and aligned with your business strategy as it scales.
In-Scope Services (Delivered via "Turbo" or "Overdrive" Pod Tiers):
1. Ongoing Governance & Cost Management
 * We help you operationalize the governance model by setting up dashboards and alerts to monitor API consumption and platform costs. This provides management with essential visibility and helps allocate costs back to the appropriate departments.
2. Security & Compliance Audits
 * Our team performs periodic reviews of deployed low-code AI solutions to ensure they remain compliant with data privacy regulations (like GDPR) and internal security policies. This is crucial for protecting the company from data breaches and compliance fines.
3. Continuous Optimization
 * As new AI models and platform features are released, our Pod works with you to continuously optimize existing workflows for better performance, lower cost, and enhanced capabilities, ensuring your solutions do not become stale or obsolete.
| AI Pod Tiers | Monthly Capacity | Ideal Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Turbo | 80 hours/month | Building Momentum: Well-suited for ongoing governance of a growing number of automations and performing quarterly security audits. |
| Overdrive | 160 hours/month | Driving Full-Scale Change: For a deep, embedded partnership where our Pod acts as the core of your AI Center of Excellence, driving large-scale adoption, continuous optimization, and strategic alignment. |
