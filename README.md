## Core Concepts & Offerings

Our value proposition is centered around two core offerings that work together to guide clients from AI ideation to full-scale implementation.

### The Jump Start Workshop

A **Jump Start** is an immersive, **2-day strategic discovery workshop**. It's designed to transform a client's complex business problem into a clear, actionable AI strategy.

* **Goal**: De-risk innovation and create a strategic roadmap.
* **Process**: Combines design thinking, capability demonstrations, and collaborative planning.
* **Key Feature**: We use **educational code** and pre-built accelerators (e.g., AIDA, Deep Research) to demonstrate possibilities. This code is a learning tool, not a production-ready solution.
* **Outcome**: A strategic roadmap, prioritized use cases, and technical architecture recommendations.
* **Primary Document**: `Jump Start Explainer.md`

### The AI Innovation Pod

The **AI Innovation Pod** is a flexible, retainer-based "Innovation as a Service" (IaaS) model. It gives clients ongoing access to a unified, cross-functional team of AI specialists.

* **Goal**: Provide the expertise needed to refine use cases, build Proofs-of-Concept (PoCs) or Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), and provide strategic advisory after a Jump Start.
* **Process**: Operates on a dynamic allocation model, deploying the right experts at the right time.
* **Engagement Tiers**:
    * **Catalyst**: 40 hours/month ($14k) - Ideal for PoCs and feasibility studies.
    * **Accelerator**: 80 hours/month ($28k) - Ideal for MVP development.
    * **Transformation**: 160 hours/month ($56k) - Ideal for full product development and deep partnership.
* **Primary Documents**: `Sogeti AI Innovation Pod.md` and `Jumpstart FAQ.md`.

## ðŸ—ºThe Customer Journey: From Ideation to Implementation

Our engagement model follows a phased approach that ensures AI initiatives are strategically aligned, de-risked, and successfully implemented.

1.  **Phase 1: Discovery & Use Case Definition (Jump Start Team)**
    * The journey begins with a **Jump Start workshop** to identify opportunities and create a strategic plan.
2.  **Phase 2: Solutioning & Scaffolding (AI Innovation Pod)**
    * The **AI Pod** refines the use cases, develops the business case, builds PoCs/MVPs, and designs the core technical architecture.
3.  **Phase 3: Last-Mile Development (Dedicated Build Team)**
    * Once the concept is validated, a full-scale build team (onshore/offshore) executes the production development, with the AI Pod providing strategic oversight.

*For a detailed description of this entire process, refer to the **`Ideation to implementation.md`** file.*
