To successfully engage and personalize the first interaction with a client about GenAI capabilities, moving beyond generic discussions, a sales executive should aim to gather the following minimal insights:
 * The Specific Business Challenge: Instead of asking "Are you interested in GenAI?", the sales executive should uncover what specific business problem or challenge the client is hoping AI will solve. This immediately shifts the conversation to value and relevance.
   * Why this is crucial: Sogeti's approach is "problem-first". We don't just sell AI capabilities; we apply AI to solve real business issues. Understanding the pain point allows us to instantly frame our expertise around a solution rather than a technology.
 * Their Current Technology Comfort Level/Existing Stack (High-Level): While detailed ecosystem knowledge isn't expected initially, understanding their comfort with certain technology stacks and platforms is valuable. This means asking: "What technology stack and platforms are you already comfortable with?"
   * Why this is crucial: Sogeti emphasizes an "infrastructure-first" approach and "integration excellence". Knowing if they are a Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or AWS shop, or if they use platforms like Salesforce or ServiceNow, allows us to immediately speak their "integration language" and position our vendor-agnostic foundation that works with their chosen technologies.
 * Their Preferred Approach to Solutioning: Understand their preference for adopting new solutions. Ask: "Are you looking to buy something off-the-shelf, build something custom, or somewhere in between?"
   * Why this is crucial: This informs whether to lead with discussions around rapid deployment of pre-built accelerators, or a more involved custom build, aligning with their strategic flexibility needs. It also helps assess if they are a good fit for the agile, exploratory nature of a Jump Start, which is designed for situations where requirements are expected to change.
 * Their Internal Capability to Support AI: A simple question about their internal readiness for AI solutions. Ask: "How much internal capability do you have to support an AI solution long-term?"
   * Why this is crucial: Sogetiâ€™s approach includes capability assessment and knowledge transfer. Understanding their internal team's maturity helps tailor the conversation around how we can empower their teams or provide ongoing support through the AI Pod model.
By obtaining these minimal pieces of information, the Jump Start team can transform a generic "GenAI capabilities" meeting into a personalized discussion centered around the client's specific context, potential pain points, and existing environment, showcasing how Sogeti's unique approach can directly address their needs and accelerate their AI journey. This shifts the focus from broad capabilities to tailored solutions and strategic partnership.
