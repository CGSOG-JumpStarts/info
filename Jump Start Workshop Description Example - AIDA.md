## Global Manufacturing Company transforms decision-making with AIDA:

### The Challenge
Enable rapid transformation of complex operational data into executive-ready insights across thousands of manufacturing KPIs, quality metrics, and supply chain data stored in multiple systems for a global manufacturing company while adhering to strict data governance policies. A key requirement was to enable non-technical stakeholders to create professional visualizations and generate compelling data narratives that drive strategic decisions.

### The Solution
Sogeti engaged the customer's data analytics and business intelligence teams through a comprehensive design thinking workshop to design a scalable AIDA architecture that integrated with existing data governance policies and operational reporting requirements. Sogeti deployed AIDA's four-module system leveraging Azure OpenAI for natural language data understanding, Azure Machine Learning for automated visualization generation, and a suite of cloud services including Power BI integration, Azure Cognitive Services, and Azure Monitor for comprehensive analytics.

### The Result
The company now has an intelligent data storytelling environment that enables business stakeholders to transform operational data into executive-ready insights in hours rather than weeks. AI-powered visualization generation understands complex manufacturing terminology and delivers contextually relevant charts and infographics. The implementation reduced visualization creation time by 80% while enabling data democratization across 40+ facilities and accelerating strategic decisions on $50M+ capital investments.

## Engagement Details:
