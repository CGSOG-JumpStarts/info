#### **What You'll Do:**

* **AI Solution Development:**
    * Design, build, and iterate on proofs-of-concept (PoCs) and Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for a wide range of AI use cases, from enterprise search and agentic workflows to intelligent document processing.
    * Develop with and integrate a variety of AI frameworks and libraries, such as LangGraph, LlamaIndex, and Semantic Kernel, maintaining our "Infrastructure Agnostic" approach.
    * Create working code that serves as an educational framework during client Jump Start workshops, demonstrating the art of the possible and illustrating complex technical concepts.

* **Technical Integration & Architecture:**
    * Partner with Solution Architects to implement AI solutions on major hyperscalers, with a strong focus on Microsoft Azure, including Azure AI and Azure OpenAI Services.
    * Focus on "Integration Excellence" by connecting AI models and solutions to clients' real business systems, data, and workflows.
    * Contribute to the development of scalable, secure, and robust AI foundations that are not tied to a single vendor, future-proofing our clients' investments.

* **Collaborative Innovation:**
    * Work within an agile, iterative workflow, collaborating daily with a cross-functional team of strategists, designers, and delivery leads to move from idea to execution with speed and precision.
    * Participate in client-facing design thinking workshops and technical deep-dive sessions, providing the hands-on expertise needed to shape strategic roadmaps.
    * Engage in continuous learning and experimentation, staying at the forefront of the rapidly evolving AI landscape to bring innovative approaches to the Pod and our clients.
