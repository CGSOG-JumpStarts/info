### **Job Title: Project Manager, AI Innovation Pod**

**Team:** Sogeti AI Innovation Pod

---

#### **Role Overview:**

As a Project Manager for the Sogeti AI Innovation Pod, you will be the operational heart of our "Innovation as a Service" (IaaS) offering. You will be responsible for orchestrating the delivery of transformative AI solutions for our clients, ensuring that our dynamic, cross-functional "brain trust" operates with maximum efficiency and impact.

This is not a traditional project management role. You will manage a portfolio of innovative, often ambiguous projects where success is measured by the achievement of measurable business outcomes, not just the on-time delivery of a pre-defined scope. You will be instrumental in managing the pod's flexible allocation model, ensuring the right experts are deployed at the right time to solve our clients' most complex challenges.

* **Project & Delivery Management:**
    * Manage the end-to-end lifecycle of client engagements, from initial scoping in a Jump Start workshop through to continuous delivery via the AI Pod.
    * Champion the pod's agile and iterative workflow, facilitating sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to ensure rapid progress and continuous learning.
    * Coordinate the dynamic allocation of the pod's diverse experts—including Solution Architects, Gen AI Developers, and Business Analysts—across multiple concurrent client projects.
    * Implement and oversee engagement governance, including tracking and reporting on hours utilized, managing budgets, and ensuring adherence to the Statement of Work.
    * Proactively manage the change control process, identifying scope changes and working with client and internal stakeholders to formalize adjustments.

* **Client & Stakeholder Communication:**
    * Serve as the primary point of contact for clients regarding project timelines, resource allocation, and budget, fostering a highly collaborative and transparent partnership.
    * Translate client needs into actionable tasks and priorities for the pod, ensuring the team remains tightly aligned with the client's strategic business objectives.
    * Prepare and deliver weekly status reports and lead check-in meetings to ensure all stakeholders are informed of progress, risks, and upcoming priorities.

* **Pod Operations & Excellence:**
    * Partner with the Pod's leadership to optimize resource utilization and capacity planning, ensuring the team can effectively serve multiple clients simultaneously.
    * Identify and implement process improvements to enhance the pod's delivery efficiency and quality.
    * Maintain comprehensive project documentation, ensuring knowledge is captured and shared effectively within the team.
