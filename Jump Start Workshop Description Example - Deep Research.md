## Global Consulting Firm revolutionizes market analysis with Deep Research:

### The Challenge
Enable comprehensive market research and competitive analysis across thousands of industry reports, regulatory documents, and market intelligence sources stored in multiple systems for a global consulting firm while ensuring factual accuracy and eliminating bias. A key requirement was to generate detailed, citation-backed research reports that could support multi-million dollar strategic recommendations for Fortune 500 clients.

### The Solution
Sogeti engaged the customer's research and strategy teams through a comprehensive design thinking workshop to design a scalable Deep Research architecture that integrated with existing knowledge management policies and client confidentiality requirements. Sogeti deployed the research agent system leveraging Azure OpenAI for intelligent question generation, Azure Cognitive Search for comprehensive source aggregation, and a suite of cloud services including automated fact-checking, bias detection, and comprehensive analytics.

### The Result
The firm now has an intelligent research environment that enables consultants to generate comprehensive, citation-backed reports spanning 20+ sources in hours rather than weeks. AI-powered research agents understand complex industry terminology and deliver factually accurate, unbiased analysis. The implementation reduced research time by 85% while improving report quality and enabling consultants to focus on high-value strategic analysis rather than information gathering.
