### **Modern Enterprise Search Jump Start**

#### **Workshop Overview**

Jump Start your Modern Enterprise Search Journey.

Sogeti's Modern Enterprise Search Jump Start allows you to set the foundation for a transformative enterprise search solution using Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our design thinking workshop rapidly identifies your organization's knowledge management challenges and designs a strategic roadmap for implementing a search solution that provides accurate, context-aware answers from your enterprise data.

Our Enterprise Search services, leveraging Azure AI and Azure OpenAI Services, integrate industry-leading large language models with advanced retrieval techniques. This empowers your employees to move beyond simple keyword searches and engage in natural language conversations with your internal knowledge bases. By leveraging the security, scalability, and seamless integration offered by the Azure cloud platform, you can confidently develop a powerful search solution that keeps your sensitive data secure within your own environment.

#### **The Challenge**

Enterprises possess vast amounts of valuable information locked away in documents, wikis, and internal systems. Traditional search tools are often ineffective, returning long lists of irrelevant links rather than direct answers. This leads to wasted time, frustrated employees, and poor decision-making based on incomplete information.

**Key Industry Statistics:**
* **4-6 hours** per week are spent by employees searching for information needed to do their jobs.
* **85%** of organizations report that information silos are a significant barrier to productivity and innovation.
* **70%** of enterprise data goes unused, failing to inform business decisions due to poor accessibility and searchability.

> Organizations lose competitive advantage when their collective knowledge remains fragmented and inaccessible, preventing employees from finding the right information at the right time.
