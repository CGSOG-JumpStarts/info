These  templates cover the full spectrum of AI sales and consulting scenarios, from initial discovery through implementation and knowledge transfer. Each template is designed to extract the specific context needed for the agent to provide highly relevant and actionable guidance.

## How to Use These Templates

**Template 1** is ideal for early-stage opportunity assessment and sales strategy development. Use this when you first engage with a potential client and need to determine the best approach.

**Template 2** works best for mid-stage engagements where you're developing detailed technical recommendations and implementation plans for qualified opportunities.

**Template 3** is perfect for generating client-facing documentation once you've qualified the opportunity and agreed on an engagement approach.

**Template 4** should be used before any significant client meeting or call where you need to gather information. This is particularly valuable for first-time meetings, executive briefings, or when moving from initial interest to detailed needs assessment. Use this 24-48 hours before the meeting to ensure you're fully prepared with the right questions and talking points.

**Template 5** is essential when you know you're in a competitive situation or when the client is evaluating multiple approaches (including doing nothing or building internally). Deploy this template as soon as competitive dynamics emerge, typically during the qualification or proposal phase. It's also useful for proactive competitive preparation in target accounts.

**Template 6** becomes critical during the negotiation and closing phases of the sales cycle. Use this when you've submitted a proposal and are facing pushback, when entering formal contract negotiations, or when you need to prepare for a final decision meeting. This template helps you anticipate and prepare for the most common roadblocks to closing deals.

**Template 7** is your go-to resource when you've won the engagement and need to plan the actual delivery. Use this 2-3 weeks before a workshop or structured engagement to ensure thorough preparation. It's particularly valuable for Jump Start workshops where client expectations are high and you need to deliver immediate value.

**Template 8** should be deployed when clients need financial justification for AI investments, typically during the proposal phase or when facing budget approval processes. Use this when selling to financially-driven organizations, when competing against lower-cost alternatives, or when the client's CFO or finance team is involved in the decision-making process.

**Template 9** is your tool for maintaining strong client relationships during ongoing engagements. Use this weekly for AI Pod engagements, at key milestones for project work, or whenever you need to communicate significant updates, issues, or changes. The template ensures consistent, professional communication that builds trust and confidence.

**Template 10** becomes relevant near the end of engagements when transitioning solutions to client teams, or early in engagements when you identify significant skill gaps that need to be addressed. Use this when clients want to build internal capabilities, when preparing teams to maintain AI solutions, or when creating lasting organizational change through education.

## Template Selection Guide

**Use Templates 1-3** for the **sales cycle**: qualification, strategy development, and documentation creation.

**Use Templates 4-6** for **sales execution**: meeting preparation, competitive situations, and closing challenges.

**Use Templates 7-8** for **engagement preparation**: workshop planning and business case development.

**Use Templates 9-10** for **delivery and transition**: ongoing communication and knowledge transfer.

## Pro Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

1. **Combine Templates**: Often you'll use multiple templates for a single opportunity. For example, use Template 1 for qualification, Template 4 for meeting prep, Template 5 for competitive positioning, and Template 3 for proposal creation.

2. **Iterate and Refine**: Start with the template, get initial guidance from the agent, then refine your inputs based on what you learn and re-run for more specific recommendations.

3. **Share Context**: The more specific context you provide, the more tailored and valuable the agent's recommendations will be. Don't hesitate to include details about client culture, competitive dynamics, or unique constraints.

4. **Adapt to Your Style**: Use the agent's output as a starting point, then adapt the language, approach, and emphasis to match your personal selling style and client relationship.

5. **Save and Reuse**: Many of the insights (especially competitive positioning and objection handling strategies) can be reused across similar opportunities in the same industry or with similar use cases.

Each template is designed to be practical and immediately actionable, helping you leverage Sogeti's knowledge base and methodologies to accelerate client engagements and improve sales outcomes.
