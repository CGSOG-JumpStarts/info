Sogeti's approach to AI transformation is a phased process that begins with strategic discovery and moves through solutioning and scaffolding to final implementation, leveraging specialized teams at each stage.
Here's a detailed process flow description:
Process Flow Description: From Jump Start to Last-Mile Development
Phase 1: Discovery & Use Case Definition (Jump Start Team)
The journey begins with a Jump Start workshop, an immersive 2-day strategic discovery experience. This phase is led by a dedicated Jump Start team, typically composed of AI Research Specialists, Knowledge Architects, and Design Thinking Facilitators. The core philosophy is strategic experimentation guided by experts, focusing on uncovering business opportunities rather than just showcasing technology.
 * Pre-Workshop Phase (1-2 Weeks):
   * Initial Alignment Meeting: Define objectives, confirm participants, and set expectations.
   * Technical Preparation: Validate environment readiness and prerequisites if deployment is desired.
   * Materials Distribution: Share preparation materials, agenda, and strategic context.
 * Day 1: Strategic Discovery:
   * Opening & Objective Alignment: Kick-off with introductions and goal setting.
   * Current State Assessment: Deep dive into existing systems, processes, and challenges, including analysis of information sources, research workflows, and knowledge discovery behaviors.
   * Capability Demonstrations: Working code examples and pre-configured accelerators (e.g., Deep Research, AIDA) illustrate AI possibilities within the business context, serving as educational frameworks.
   * Initial Use Case Identification: Collaborative identification of potential opportunities.
   * End-of-Day Review: Recap key findings and align on Day 2 focus.
 * Day 2: Strategic Planning:
   * Deep Dive Sessions: Detailed exploration of selected opportunities.
   * Technical Architecture Discussions: Infrastructure requirements and integration considerations are discussed.
   * Roadmap Development: A prioritized implementation plan with timelines and resource requirements is developed.
   * Next Steps Planning: Clear action items and continuation strategy are defined.
   * Closing & Handoff: Summary of discoveries and delivery of comprehensive documentation.
 * Post-Workshop Phase (5 Business Days):
   * Documentation Delivery: Complete handoff of all materials including code repository, technical documentation, and strategic recommendations.
   * Optional Follow-up Session: Address questions after materials review.
   * Pod Engagement Planning: If desired, structure ongoing AI Pod support.
Phase 2: Solutioning & Scaffolding (AI Pod)
Following the Jump Start, the engagement often transitions to the AI Innovation Pod, a revolutionary delivery model providing flexible access to a unified team of specialists. The Pod is designed for ongoing strategic advisory, refinement, and proof-of-concept/MVP development.
 * Refinement & Business Case Development:
   * The Pod refines use cases identified during the Jump Start, developing detailed business requirements and calculating ROI to build strong business cases.
   * They lead strategic discussions and roadmap development, aligning technical capabilities with business outcomes.
 * Technical Scaffolding & Prototyping:
   * The Pod assists in deploying and configuring initial infrastructure, such as research agent architecture (planner, execution, publisher agents) for Deep Research or AIDA's four-module architecture (Summarizer, Goal Explorer, VisGenerator, Infographer).
   * They configure Azure OpenAI Services and initial orchestration layers for data protection and governance.
   * They develop technical proofs-of-concept (POC) and Minimum Viable Products (MVP) to validate concepts and demonstrate tangible progress. This includes hands-on demonstrations using educational code frameworks.
 * Architecture Design & Governance:
   * The AI Pod provides technical architecture guidance, advising on integration approaches and sharing insights on security and scalability considerations.
   * They establish governance frameworks for AI-generated content, quality assurance, and source verification.
Phase 3: Last-Mile Development (Dedicated Build Team)
Once the solution is well-defined, the scaffolding is in place, and the MVP is validated, a larger, dedicated build team (onshore or offshore) is brought in for full-scale production implementation.
 * Transition & Strategic Oversight:
   * The AI Pod maintains strategic oversight and quality assurance throughout the full-scale implementation.
   * The Pod assists in defining the scope and requirements for the dedicated build team based on the validated POC/MVP.
 * Production Development & Integration:
   * Specialized delivery teams (onshore/offshore) execute the production development of the AI solution. This includes writing production-ready code, large-scale data preparation, and full system integration.
   * The focus shifts from advisory and prototyping to robust, scalable, and secure production deployment.
 * Knowledge Transfer & Optimization:
   * The Jump Start and Pod engagement phases include knowledge transfer to enable internal teams.
   * The dedicated build team ensures ongoing optimization and scaling of the deployed solution, with continued guidance from the AI Pod for strategic direction and advanced problem-solving.
This phased approach ensures that AI initiatives are strategically aligned from the start, de-risked through iterative prototyping, and ultimately scaled effectively for long-term business value.
