Here are two templates you can adapt for your weekly and monthly value reports. They are designed to be clear, concise, and focused on demonstrating progress and value, making the sign-off process smooth.

## Weekly Value Report Template
Purpose: To provide a tactical update on weekly activities, demonstrate progress, and align on next steps. This should be a lightweight report, often sent as the body of an email before your weekly steering meeting.

Subject: Weekly Value Report: [Project Name] - Week of [Start Date]
Project: [Project Name - e.g., "Project Aether: AI Environment Modernization"]
Date Range: [Start Date] to [End Date] (e.g., August 11, 2025 - August 15, 2025)
1. Hours & Capacity Summary
 * Hours This Week: [e.g., 40.0 hours]
 * Total Hours Consumed: [e.g., 80.0 hours]
 * Remaining Capacity: [e.g., 240.0 hours / 320 total]
2. Key Accomplishments This Week
This section lists specific, completed tasks. Link directly to artifacts where possible.
 * Architecture Review:
   * Completed initial discovery sessions with the data science and platform teams.
   * Drafted the "Current State" architecture diagram in Miro [Link to Miro board].
 * MLOps:
   * Analyzed the existing model deployment script and documented key bottlenecks [Link to Confluence doc].
 * IaaC Development:
   * Set up the initial GitLab repository for IaaC modules [Link to GitLab repo].
   * Developed and tested the foundational Terraform module for creating a secure S3 bucket for agent data.
3. Demoed in Weekly Steering Meeting
 * Walked through the "Current State" architecture diagram.
 * Showcased the successful test run of the S3 bucket IaaC module.
4. Priorities for Next Week (As Agreed)
 * Architecture: Begin drafting the "Target State" architecture diagram incorporating serverless and container-based components.
 * MLOps: Create a proposal for a standardized CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI.
 * IaaC: Develop the IaaC module for the initial IAM roles and policies required by a new agent.
5. Blockers or Risks
 * [e.g., "No current blockers." or "Need access to the production AWS account to validate current IAM settings. Awaiting credentials."]

## Monthly Value Report Template
Purpose: To provide a strategic summary of the month's achievements, directly linking the work performed to the project's overall goals. This is the key document to justify the monthly invoice. It should be sent as a PDF attachment.
Monthly Value Report

1. Executive Summary
A brief, high-level overview for a busy executive. What was the focus, and what was the result?
In August 2025, our team focused on foundational discovery and initial development. We completed a comprehensive review of the current AI environment architecture and delivered the first set of reusable Infrastructure-as-Code (IaaC) modules. This work has established a clear baseline for modernization and will accelerate the creation of self-service agent environments in the coming month.
2. Hours & Capacity Summary
| Description | This Month | Project to Date |
|---|---|---|
| Total Hours Consumed | [e.g., 160.0 hours] | [e.g., 160.0 hours] |
| Total Project Capacity |  | 320.0 hours |
| Remaining Capacity |  | [e.g., 160.0 hours] |
3. Progress Against Project Goals
This is the most critical section. It connects your detailed work back to the "why."
| Project Goal | August Accomplishments | Business Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Goal 1: Documented and approved target architecture for AI environment. | ✔️ Completed discovery and mapped current state architecture. <br> ✔️ Initiated target state design sessions. | Provides a clear baseline to de-risk future design decisions and align stakeholders. |
| Goal 2: Enable team on MLOps best practices. | ✔️ Analyzed current deployment process and identified key bottlenecks. | Highlights specific opportunities to reduce manual effort and deployment errors. |
| Goal 3: Create reusable IaaC for self-service agent creation. | ✔️ Established IaaC repository and standards. <br> ✔️ Delivered production-ready modules for core data storage (S3) and security (IAM). | These modules form the building blocks for rapid, standardized agent deployment. |
4. Key Artifacts & Deliverables
