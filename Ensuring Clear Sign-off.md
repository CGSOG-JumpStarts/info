### **Ensuring Clear Sign-off for Advisory Services in a Fixed-Capacity SOW**

For a fixed-capacity engagement focused on advisory services, the key to successful sign-off lies in shifting the focus from traditional, quantitative deliverables (e.g., "build X") to process-oriented and evidence-based milestones. The goal is to create a clear paper trail of guidance provided, recommendations made, and collaborative sessions held, which collectively demonstrate the value delivered within the agreed-upon hours.

Here is a breakdown of how to structure your Statement of Work (SOW) to ensure you can get sign-off for each work item, providing flexibility for the customer while protecting your scope.

---

### **1. General Best Practices for the SOW**

Before addressing the specific items, incorporate these general clauses at the beginning of your SOW:

*   **Define "Advisory":** Explicitly state that the nature of the engagement is advisory, consultative, and collaborative. The primary deliverable is expert guidance, architectural review, strategic recommendations, and co-development of frameworks, not the production-level implementation of code or systems.
*   **Time & Materials on a Fixed-Capacity Basis:** Clarify that the engagement is for a fixed capacity of 160 hours per month for two months. State that Capgemini/Sogeti will provide a monthly report detailing the hours consumed against the work items. This structure itself is a form of milestone; completion of the hours for the month is a payable event.
*   **Assumption of Client Participation:** State that the successful delivery of these advisory services is contingent upon the timely and active participation of the client's key personnel (e.g., architects, product owners, governance leads).
*   **Definition of "Accepted" or "Completed":** For non-quantitative work, "acceptance" should not be based on the client's subjective agreement with the advice, but on the successful delivery and documentation of the advisory activity.

**Define Acceptance Criteria as:**
> "A work item or deliverable shall be considered accepted upon Capgemini/Sogeti's delivery of the specified output (e.g., workshop summary, recommendation document, architectural diagram) and the client's confirmation of receipt. The client shall have five (5) business days to review and provide feedback. If no feedback is provided, the deliverable will be deemed accepted. Acceptance is based on the completeness of the deliverable as described, not on the client's decision to implement the recommendations."

### **2. Structuring Sign-off for Each SOW Work Item**

Hereâ€™s how to reframe your SOW items with clear, sign-off-ready deliverables.

#### **Work Item 1: Strategic Architecture Evolution**

*   **Challenge:** "Pressure-test," "refine," and "evolve" are subjective terms.
*   **Solution:** Tie sign-off to tangible outputs of the collaborative process.

**SOW Language & Deliverables for Sign-off:**

> **1.1. Architectural Review Workshops:** Capgemini/Sogeti will conduct a series of `[Number, e.g., 4-6]` structured workshops with the client architects.
>     *   **Deliverable:** For each workshop, Capgemini/Sogeti will deliver a **Workshop Summary Document** within `[e.g., 3]` business days, outlining attendees, key discussion points, architectural challenges identified, and preliminary recommendations. **(Sign-off on each summary document).**
>
> **1.2. Gap Analysis Report:** Based on the architectural workshops, Capgemini/Sogeti will produce a **Strategic Gap Analysis Report**. This document will identify specific areas where the current architecture can be enhanced for scalability, security, and alignment with the "AI First" vision.
>     *   **Deliverable:** A formal **Gap Analysis Report document**. This is a key milestone for sign-off.
>
> **1.3. Evolved Architecture Recommendations:** Capgemini/Sogeti will deliver a presentation and accompanying document detailing **Recommended Architectural Modifications**. This will include revised diagrams for key components (e.g., multi-agent orchestration, vector retrieval patterns) and a high-level roadmap for implementation.
>     *   **Deliverable:** A **presentation slide deck** and **Architectural Recommendation Document**. **(Final sign-off for this work stream).**

#### **Work Item 2: Maturing AI/ML Operations and Practices**

*   **Challenge:** "Targeted guidance" and "co-developing" are difficult to quantify.
*   **Solution:** Focus on the creation and delivery of documented, reusable assets.

**SOW Language & Deliverables for Sign-off:**

> **2.1. MLOps Maturity Assessment:** Capgemini/Sogeti will conduct a review of the client's existing MLOps, agentic workflow, and prompt engineering processes.
>     *   **Deliverable:** A **Maturity Assessment Findings Document** outlining current state, strengths, and areas for improvement, delivered by `[Date or Sprint]`. **(Sign-off on the document).**
>
> **2.2. Reference Architecture Development:** Capgemini/Sogeti will co-develop and document a set of **Advanced Reference Architectures and Implementation Patterns**.
>     *   **Deliverable:** A portfolio of documents and diagrams, delivered iteratively, including:
>         *   Reference Architecture for MLOps on GitLab.
>         *   Implementation Pattern for Dynamic Agentic Workflows.
>         *   Standardized Prompt Engineering Lifecycle Document.
>         *   **(Sign-off on each delivered asset).**
>
> **2.3. AI Agent Lifecycle Framework:** Capgemini/Sogeti will deliver a formal framework document defining the end-to-end lifecycle for AI agents.
>     *   **Deliverable:** An **AI Agent Lifecycle Management Framework Document**, covering stages from registration and testing to production monitoring and retirement. **(Final sign-off for this work stream).**

#### **Work Item 3: Accelerating Enterprise AI Governance**

*   **Challenge:** "Accelerate," "operationalize," and "assist" are process-oriented, not output-oriented.
*   **Solution:** Define deliverables that show the "how-to" and the strategic plan for operationalization.

**SOW Language & Deliverables for Sign-off:**

> **3.1. Governance Integration Strategy Sessions:** Capgemini/Sogeti will lead working sessions to map AI governance controls to existing enterprise systems (ServiceNow, LeanIX, etc.).
>     *   **Deliverable:** **Session Summary Documents** detailing proposed integration points and data flows for each system. **(Sign-off on each summary).**
>
> **3.2. Policy-as-Code Rule Library:** Capgemini/Sogeti will provide a set of **Recommended Policy-as-Code Rules and Guardrail Definitions** for implementation within Boomi. These will be delivered as documented templates.
>     *   **Deliverable:** A **Policy-as-Code Rulebook Document** containing `[e.g., 10-15]` specific, templated rules for AI compliance. **(Sign-off on the rulebook).**
>
> **3.3. Matured AI Capability Model:** Capgemini/Sogeti will review and provide documented recommendations to enhance the client's existing AI capability model to better automate compliance checks.
>     *   **Deliverable:** A **presentation** and **document outlining the recommended enhancements** to the AI capability model. **(Final sign-off for this work stream).**

#### **Work Item 4: Scaling Self-Service AI Enablement**

*   **Challenge:** "Co-design," "formalize," and "stress-testing" need tangible proof of completion.
*   **Solution:** Create documented frameworks, test plans, and architectural designs that the client can then implement.

**SOW Language & Deliverables for Sign-off:**

> **4.1. Federated Developer Model Framework:** Capgemini/Sogeti will co-design and deliver a **Federated AI Development Framework Document**. This document will define roles, responsibilities, security guardrails, and the SDLC for citizen-developed workflows on n8n and Boomi.
>     *   **Deliverable:** The formal **Framework Document**. **(Sign-off on this key document).**
>
> **4.2. Platform Resilience Test Plan:** Capgemini/Sogeti will design a **Resilience and Performance Stress Test Plan**. This is not the execution of the test, but the documented plan for how the client can conduct it.
>     *   **Deliverable:** A **Test Plan Document** including methodologies, tools, and success criteria for testing the underlying platform. **(Sign-off on the plan).**
>
> **4.3. Enterprise Architecture for Self-Service:** Capgemini/Sogeti will deliver a formal **Enterprise Architecture Document for Self-Service AI**. This will include architectural diagrams and security patterns required to support broad adoption.
>     *   **Deliverable:** An **Enterprise Architecture Document**. **(Final sign-off for this work stream).**

By structuring the SOW this way, you create a cadence of tangible, reviewable deliverables throughout the two-month engagement. This allows the client to see progress and formally accept work in stages, while giving Capgemini/Sogeti clear, defensible milestones to bill against, effectively mitigating the risk of disputes over non-quantitative advisory work.
