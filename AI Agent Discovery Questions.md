A list of discovery questions to help decide if a use case is a good scenario for AI Agents/Agentic AI, or if it is too ill-defined or incorporates too much risk, drawing from Sogeti's approach to AI innovation:

## Category 1: Understanding the Problem & Agentic Potential
 * Describe the specific end-to-end process or task you're looking to automate or enhance with AI. What are the current manual steps involved?
 * What kind of decisions or actions are currently made by humans within this process? Are these rule-based, or do they require complex reasoning?
 * How many different systems, data sources, or tools does a human currently interact with to complete this task?
 * Is the process linear and predictable, or does it involve frequent changes, branching logic, or dynamic adaptation?
 * What is the desired outcome or "mission" for the AI agent? Can this mission be clearly defined and measured?
 * Are there repetitive, high-volume tasks that, if automated, would free up significant human capacity?
 * Does the task require synthesizing information from multiple, disparate sources to reach a conclusion?
 * How critical is the speed of execution for this process? Would accelerating it provide a significant business advantage?
 * Is there a need for continuous learning or adaptation based on new data or changing conditions within the process?
 * Can you identify a specific "starting trigger" and a "definitive end state" for the agent's work?
## Category 2: Data Environment & Information Access
 * What data sources (internal/external, structured/unstructured) would the AI agent need to access to perform its task?
 * What is the quality, consistency, and completeness of the data the agent would rely on? Are there known data integrity issues?
 * How frequently does this data change or need to be refreshed? Is real-time access a requirement?
 * Are there any sensitive or confidential data types involved that would require specific security, compliance, or governance protocols?
 * How is information currently extracted, processed, or summarized from unstructured documents or conversations?
 * Are there existing APIs or standardized interfaces for accessing the necessary data and systems?
 * What is the typical volume of information or number of sources an agent would need to process per transaction/query?
 * Is there a mechanism to verify the factual accuracy of information pulled from sources?
 * How would the agent handle ambiguous, incomplete, or conflicting information?
 * What are the current challenges in integrating data across different systems for this process?
## Category 3: Decision-Making & Autonomy
 * What is the level of autonomy desired for the AI agent? Should it execute decisions fully, or propose actions for human review?
 * Are the decisions required within the process based on strict rules, or do they involve subjective judgment or creativity?
 * How critical are the decisions made by the agent? What is the impact of an incorrect or biased decision?
 * Can the decision-making process be broken down into smaller, discrete steps or sub-tasks for an agent to manage?
 * Is there a clear "ground truth" or set of criteria against which an agent's decisions can be evaluated and refined?
 * How would human oversight or intervention be built into the agentic workflow?
 * What mechanisms would be needed to audit or explain the agent's reasoning or actions?
 * Are there situations where the agent would need to "hand off" tasks to a human or another system?
 * What is your tolerance for errors or unexpected outcomes from an autonomous system, especially in initial phases?
 * Can the agent learn and adapt its decision-making over time, or is a fixed logic sufficient?
## Category 4: Risk, Governance & Ethics
 * What are the primary risks associated with automating this particular process with AI (e.g., financial, reputational, legal, operational)?
 * Are there any ethical considerations or potential for bias in the data or decision-making process that need to be addressed?
 * What are your organization's existing governance frameworks for AI, data privacy, and security?
 * How would you handle situations where the AI agent produces an incorrect, biased, or unexpected outcome?
 * What are your requirements for audit trails, logging, and traceability of agent actions and decisions?
 * How will you ensure compliance with relevant industry regulations or internal policies?
 * Is there a clear accountability framework for decisions made by the AI agent?
 * What is the impact of potential "hallucinations" or inaccuracies from large language models if they are part of the agent's capabilities?
 * How will you manage the evolution of the agent's capabilities to mitigate new or unforeseen risks?
 * What level of human-in-the-loop validation or supervision is non-negotiable for this use case?
## Category 5: Human Interaction & User Experience
 * Who are the end-users or human stakeholders who will interact with or be impacted by the AI agent?
 * How will these users provide input to the agent, and how will they receive outputs or insights?
 * What kind of user experience (UX) is required for the agent's interfaces (e.g., chat, dashboard, automated reports)?
 * How will the agent communicate its progress, status, or any issues to human users?
 * What training or change management initiatives would be necessary for successful adoption by your teams?
 * How will the agent handle situations where human clarification or intervention is needed?
 * Is the goal to fully replace human tasks, or to augment human capabilities and free them for higher-value work?
 * How will user feedback be collected and incorporated into the agent's refinement process?
 * Are there specific accessibility requirements for the agent's interfaces?
 * How will you measure user satisfaction and adoption of the agentic solution?
## Category 6: Scalability, Performance & Maintenance
 * What is the anticipated volume of transactions or queries the AI agent would need to handle (e.g., per hour, per day)?
 * What are the performance requirements for the agent (e.g., response time, throughput)?
 * How critical is the availability and reliability of the agentic system? What are the uptime requirements?
 * What are your long-term scalability requirements for this solution? How might the scope or volume grow?
 * Who would be responsible for maintaining, monitoring, and updating the AI agent post-deployment?
 * What is your strategy for continuous improvement and iteration of AI solutions?
 * How will new data or evolving business rules be incorporated into the agent's knowledge or logic?
 * What are your infrastructure and resource constraints for supporting an agentic system?
 * Are you interested in Sogeti providing ongoing support and optimization through an AI Pod model?
 * How would you handle potential failures or unexpected behaviors of the AI agent in a production environment?
## Category 7: Project Viability & Strategic Alignment
 * What is the estimated time-to-value or expected timeframe to see a return on investment for this initiative?
 * What existing internal expertise do you have related to AI, data engineering, or software development that could support this project?
 * Is this project considered exploratory R&D, or is it expected to deliver a production-ready solution within a fixed scope?
 * How open are you to an iterative, agile approach where requirements may evolve as we learn more?
 * What is the potential for this specific agentic use case to be replicated or scaled to other areas of the business?
 * Are there any current initiatives or dependencies that this AI agent project would interact with or impact?
 * How would this solution position your organization competitively in the market?
 * What is your organization's comfort level with leveraging external expertise for strategic AI initiatives?
 * Are you primarily focused on achieving a specific business result, or on building out a new technological capability?
 * What would be the biggest internal obstacle to the successful adoption and integration of an AI agent solution?
